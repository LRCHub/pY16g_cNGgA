Back to you, that's where I go
When I'm so fed up, when I can't go on
In your arms that's all to
When I'm awfully tired, when I need love and I need love

It's 3 AM when I can hear you breathing
No, I'm fast asleep, no, I'm deeply dreaming
In your arms that's all to
When I'm awfully tired, when I need love

Back to you

Back to you

Back to you, that's where I go
When I'm so fed up, when I can't go on
In your arms that's all to
When I'm awfully tired, when I need love and I need love
